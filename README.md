# TrumpGBA
TrumpGBA is a program for the Game Boy Advance that displays the mugshot of Donald Trump in all its limited, pixelated glory.
I have released two versions, though the open source on this repository is the version I wrote. The other version has music and
was created with the GBA JPEG Viewer.

# NOTE
The GBA JPEG Viewer version is in much higher quality. I had to convert the original picture to a .pcx in order to fit under the
GBA's palette system. For the GBA JPEG Viewer version, I didn't need to do this and just added the original file to the slideshow.

# How to Build
Download and extract the zip folder. Run a CLI in the folder and run the "make" command. The output will be TrumpGBA.gba and
Trump.elf. Use an emulator like Visual Boy Advance on a PC and load the GBA file.

# Download
The TrumpGBA.gba is the soundless version decompiled on this repository. BadassTrump.gba is the version with music (built with the JPEG
Viewer).

Special thanks to Tony Saivon for the GBA JPEG Viewer
