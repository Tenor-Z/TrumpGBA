# TrumpGBA
TrumpGBA is a program for the Game Boy Advance that displays the mugshot of Donald Trump in all its limited, pixelated glory.
I have released two versions, though the open source on this repository is the version I wrote. The other version has music and
was created with the GBA JPEG Viewer.

# How to Build
Download and extract the zip folder. Run a CLI in the folder and run the "make" command. The output will be TrumpGBA.gba and
Trump.elf. Use an emulator like Visual Boy Advance on a PC and load the GBA file.

# Download
The TrumpGBA.gba is the soundless version decompiled on this repository. BadassTrump.gba is the version with music (built with the JPEG
Viewer).
